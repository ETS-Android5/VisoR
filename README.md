VisoR - Altering Vision via Streamed Optical Remapping
=====

Welcome to the [Project VisoR](http://projectvisor.com/) Github Repo

The main project here at the moment is Reality Hacker VR, an android application which allows us to perform real-time image processing on the world around us. Coupling this processing with a VR headset, allows us to experience our world in new light.

If you're a developer interested in getting involved, welcome!
The important files can be found under
- Cyberspace/digitalrain (latest)
- Workspace/VisionHacker (archived - stable)

Other files involve various stage of experimentation and exploration, and need to be properly archived.

VisoR was developed by [@sa501428](https://github.com/sa501428).
