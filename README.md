VisoR - Altering Vision via Streamed Optical Remapping
=====

Welcome to the [Project VisoR](http://projectvisor.com/) Github Repo

The main project here at the moment is Reality Hacker VR, an android application which allows us to perform real-time image processing on the world around us. Coupling this processing with a VR headset, allows us to experience our world in new light.

If you're a developer interested in getting involved, welcome!

VisoR is currently maintained by @sa501428.
