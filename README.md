VisoR - Altering Vision via Streamed Optical Remapping
=====

Welcome to the [Project VisoR](http://projectvisor.com/) Github Repo

The main project here at the moment is Reality Hacker VR, an android application which allows us to perform real-time image processing on the world around us. Coupling this processing with a VR headset, allows us to experience our world in new light.

If you're a developer interested in getting involved, Welcome!
The important files can be found under
- DevSpace/DigitalRain (latest)
- DevSpace/VisionHacker (stable)

You should be able to import these projects directly into Eclipse or your preferred editor (import Eclipse Project).
Other archived files involve various stages of experimentation and exploration.

VisoR was developed by [@sa501428](https://github.com/sa501428).
